      <h3>a ROBOT in a web development</h3>
      <p>
        It is true that robotics will grow as a field, potentially faster than <span class="tomato-color">web development.</span> However, even as it grows, it will never come close to the number of web servers and web sites that need development. The potential for hiring in the robotics field is much smaller than the web development field.
        
        You also would likely require more training and experience to be able to have a career in robotics.
        
        Granted, those in robotics will be paid better - but that is because there’s fewer of them and they can demand more.
        
        I’d rather be employed for less than searching for highly paid employment.</p>

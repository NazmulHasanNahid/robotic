      <h3>a ROBOT in a web development</h3>
      <p>
        It is true that robotics will grow as a field, potentially faster than <span class="tomato-color">web development.</span> However, even as it grows, it will never come close to the number of web servers and web sites that need development. The potential for hiring in the robotics field is much smaller than the web development field.
        
        You also would likely require more training and experience to be able to have a career in robotics.
        
        Granted, those in robotics will be paid better - but that is because there’s fewer of them and they can demand more.
        
        I’d rather be employed for less than searching for highly paid employment.</p>

      <p class="need-padding">Social robots become increasingly human-like in appearance and behaviour. However, a large body of research shows that these robots tend to elicit negative feelings of eeriness, danger, and threat. In the present study, we explored whether and how human-like appearance and mind-attribution contribute to these negative feelings and clarified possible underlying mechanisms. Participants were presented with pictures of mechanical, humanoid, and android robots, and physical anthropomorphism (Studies 1–3), attribution of mind perception of agency and experience (Studies 2 and 3), threat to human–machine distinctiveness, and damage to humans and their identity were assessed for all three robot types. Replicating earlier research, human–machine distinctiveness mediated the influence of anthropomorphic discussed.</p>

        <p >Web developers will eventually become obsolete when we all move to whatever technology inevitably replaces the internet. However, given the state of the world, that day is not on the horizon. Automated development is proving to be much harder than one would imagine.</p>
